## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

Before you begin:
- This project is powered by Unity. Make sure you're on the version of Unity that I currently support: `2019.3.1f1`
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/egemenertugrul/LuxVR/issues) & see if we [accept contributions](#types-of-contributions-memo) for your type of issue.

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/egemenertugrul/LuxVR/issues/) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/egemenertugrul/LuxVR/issues/new/choose). I'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. 

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, and open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, I will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, I may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out the [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! And thank you for contributing to an open-source VR application. You are a hero! :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the [contributor chart](https://github.com/egemenertugrul/LuxVR/graphs/contributors).

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Reviewing
I will personally review every single PR. Yes.

### Self-review
You should always review your own PR first before submitting. 

### Suggested changes
I may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
